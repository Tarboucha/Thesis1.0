## ðŸ“Œ Description
This thesis project focuses on the development of a simulation environment in Unity, designed to train reinforcement learning (RL) models for optimizing the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP).
Once trained, an intermediate layer is implemented to facilitate the export and deployment of these models for real-world applications. 
The objective is to bridge the gap between virtual training environments and practical implementation, ensuring seamless integration and usability across different platforms.


This repository is organized into the following main folders:

ðŸ“‚ Assets
This folder contains all assets related to the Unity project, including scripts, textures, prefabs, and configurations.
For more details about its structure and contents, refer to the README file within this folder.

ðŸ“‚ Intermediate Layer
This folder contains the code responsible for exporting trained reinforcement learning models from the Unity simulation to a real-world setup.
The intermediate layer ensures seamless integration and deployment of models for practical applications.

ðŸ“‚ Export
This folder includes a Python script designed to convert real-world characteristics into a JSON file format that is adapted for Unity.
This transformation allows the simulation to accurately interpret and utilize real-world data, ensuring improved realism and adaptability.
