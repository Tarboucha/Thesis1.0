This folder contains the core Unity elements developed throughout this project to replicate our use cases. 
These elements were designed, compiled, and trained using Unity's development infrastructure, including its ML-Agents machine learning library. 
The training process was conducted on a dedicated server to optimize efficiency and computational performance.


ðŸ“‚ ML-Agents Folder: Contains trained models using different configurations to optimize simulation performance.
ðŸ“‚ Prefabs Folder: Stores Unity prefabs used throughout the simulation, ensuring reusability and modularity.
ðŸ“‚ Scenes Folder: Contains multiple simulation scenes, each representing different starting configurations and arrangements of prefabs to simulate various scenarios.
ðŸ“‚ Scripts Folder: Includes C# scripts developed to define the behavior of different elements within the simulation and ensure their coordination and interaction during runtime.
